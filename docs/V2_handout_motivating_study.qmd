# The Motivating Study

Our motivating study is the ADHD SMART (PI: Pelham), an example of a prototypical SMART.

# Scope of Follow-Along and Code-Along Sessions in this Module

The workflow and code we will be using in the Follow-Along and Code-Along sessions in this module will be specifically applicable to one of the most common types prototypical SMARTs. These are prototypical SMARTs where:

-   the probability of being assigned one of two first-stage intervention options is 0.5 (i.e., $P_1=0.5$)
-   among non-responders, the probability of being assigned to one of two second-stage intervention options is 0.5 (i.e., $P_2=0.5$)

Extending the workflow and code to accommodate prototypical SMARTs where either $P_1 \neq 0.5$ or $P_2 \neq 0.5$ is easy once you understand the fundamentals.
